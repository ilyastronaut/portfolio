      <p className="text-sm">
        I&apos;m a passionate self-taught software developer, proudly
        Franco-Belgian, with a deep love for building innovative, scalable, and
        user-friendly applications. I started coding as a kid, tinkering with my
        computer to figure out how the applications I used every day actually
        worked. Since then, I&apos;ve explored a wide range of technologies,
        from frontend to backend. Today, software development is at the heart of
        everything I do.
